NOTE ON BATCHISP DOWNLOAD EXAMPLES
==================================

The path of the directory of "batchisp.exe" must be included
in the user variable "Path" of the "environment variables".

So, the instruction: LOADBUFFER "can128_ringtones_x.hex" can
work without include the path, the path used will be the path
of where the "batcisp" command will be executed.
