NOTE ON BATCHISP TESTS
======================

The path of the directory of "batchisp.exe" must be included
in the user variable "Path" of the "environment variables".

So, the instruction: INCLUDE "can128_tst-1_configurations.txt"
and similar can work without include the path, the path used
will be the path of where the "batcisp" command will be executed.
